    "product_analysis": "The Hanes Men's Boxers (B07T9Z8G7B) are a 5-pack of cotton knit boxer underwear.  Based on assumptions and typical customer feedback for similar products, potential issues include shrinkage, inconsistent sizing, and durability concerns.  A detailed product description and customer reviews are needed for a complete analysis.",
    "competitor_analysis": "Competitors like BALENNZ Athletic Shorts offer additional features (pockets) and target a more specific market (active lifestyle).  Hanes Boxer Briefs offer similar products but lack detailed information for comparison.  BALENNZ receives positive feedback on comfort and value but has issues with sizing consistency and material thinness.  A direct price comparison is needed for a more complete analysis.",
    "recommendations": "To increase sales, Hanes should improve product quality (pre-shrunk cotton, reinforced stitching, consistent sizing), add features (moisture-wicking, varied styles), provide a detailed product description, and actively solicit and respond to customer feedback.  Targeted marketing focusing on comfort and value is also crucial."
